                <p>There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain</p>
                <p>When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same</p>
                <p>Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name</p>
                <p>'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah</p>

                <p>Everybody hurts sometimes</p>
                <p>Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy</p>
                <p>But everything gon' be alright</p>
                <p>Go and raise a glass and say, ayy</p>
